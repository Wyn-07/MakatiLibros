The former Miss Veronidia Gutierrez Garcia now Mrs. Veronidia Garcia Garcia, was appointed library custodian. The library was located in a small room at the back of the Makati Fire Department. It had spare furniture consisting of a long plywood table, two long benches, an office table for the librarian and bookshelves enough to contain the 300 volumes of books which the library acquired as initial stock from the Bureau of Public Libraries, now The National Library. Another 500 volumes of books were later acquired from the defunct House of Representative at the instance of Mrs. Dolores Marcelo Rivera. Some civic spirited citizens subscribed to two newspapers for the library. An average of 100 persons used to come daily to the library in spite of the sparsity of reading materials, most of them, students and out-of-school youths. As the years passed, some changes in the library took place. But these were mostly insignificant because of a new Mayor, new personnel managed the library and its location was also changed.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, the library was moved to the 4th floor of the new Municipal Building during the term of the late Mayor Maximo Estrella. The mayor launched a program upgrading all departments of the Municipal Govemment and the library began an important phase of development with the upgrading facilities including the purchased of new books. When typhoon Yoling partially destroyed the building in 1967, the library was moved to the 2dn floor of the old municipal building.\r\n\r\nWhen the late Mayor Nemesio I. Yabut assumed office in 1972, one of his first moves was the relocation of the library to the second floor of the Essale Building at J. P. Rizal Avenue corner Makati Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, the library was able to have a Bookmobile library donated by the USAID. The Bookmobile was the first of its kind in Metro Manila. It was able to serve different schools and some far barrios of Makati. In the latter part of 1981, the bookmobile unit had mechanical trouble forcing the library staff to stop operations.\r\nIn time for the 1984 - 1985 school year, the Ayala Corporation on the occasion of its 150th Anniversary, donated 749 books on different subjects and on different school levels. The repair of the office equipment were also paid by the Ayala Corporation.\r\n\r\n');

The former Miss Veronidia Gutierrez Garcia now Mrs. Veronidia Garcia Garcia, was appointed library custodian. The library was located in a small room at the back of the Makati Fire Department.

Another 500 volumes of books were later acquired from the defunct House of Representative at the instance of Mrs. Dolores Marcelo Rivera. Some civic spirited citizens subscribed to two newspapers for the library. An average of 100 persons used to come daily to the library in spite of the sparsity of reading materials, most of them, students and out-of-school youths.
